## About project
The purpose of the course work is to create a program that will give the user the ability to visually solve a system of linear algebraic equations of a user-defined dimension by three methods of choice (LUP method, Hauschka Gauss-Holecki (square root) method, rotation method). Software development using OOP is mastered. Meaningful problem statements, descriptions of their individual mathematical models, a detailed process of solving each of them is described. The software implementation of solving systems of linear algebraic equations by the LUP, Gauss-Holecki and rotation methods.
